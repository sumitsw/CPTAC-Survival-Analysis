### Kaplan-Meier Estimation and Median Survival
In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis:
1. The **survival probability \( S(t) \)** is calculated at each time point based on the number of individuals at risk and the number of events (deaths) that occur.
2. The **median survival time** is defined as the time when the survival probability \( S(t) \) drops to **50% or below**.

---

### Your Data:
Looking at the survival rates \( S(t) \) in your table:
- The survival rate starts at 1 (100%) and gradually decreases.
- At **time 1537**, the survival rate \( S(t) \) drops to **0.305**, which is below 0.5.
- The **previous survival probability** before time 1537 (at 1395) was **0.61**, which was still above 50%.

Therefore:
- The **median survival time** is the **time closest to when \( S(t) \) drops to or below 0.5**.
- In your case, this happens at **time 1537**.

---

### Why 50% Deaths and Median Survival Time Don't Always Align
The **median survival time** in Kaplan-Meier analysis is based on survival probabilities, not a direct count of individuals who experienced the event. 

For example:
- If you start with 28 participants and only 8 experience the event, the survival probability \( S(t) \) can still drop below 50% due to the way Kaplan-Meier handles censored data.
- Censored data does not "reduce the denominator" in the same way as deaths (events), which means the survival probability can drop below 50% even if fewer than half of the participants experienced the event.

---

### In Summary:
The **median survival time of 1537** is valid because:
1. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability \( S(t) \) dropped below 50% at that time point.
2. It is **not based on counting deaths directly** but on the survival probability, which accounts for both deaths and censored data.
