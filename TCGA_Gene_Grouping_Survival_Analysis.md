### Purpose of the Code:
This code performs data preparation for survival analysis by:
1. Loading a CSV file containing survival and gene expression data.
2. Cleaning and transforming the dataset, including handling missing values and renaming columns.
3. Identifying gene expression columns for further analysis.
4. Computing the median expression value for each gene to categorize data in future steps.

### Code with Detailed Comments:
```r
# Load the necessary libraries for survival analysis and visualization
library(survival)
library(survminer)

# Step 1: Prompt the user to select a CSV file and load the data into a dataframe
file_path <- file.choose()  # Opens a file dialog to select the CSV file
x <- read.csv(file_path, header = TRUE)  # Load the selected file with column headers

# Step 2: Define the name of the primary gene of interest
gene_name <- "ACLY"

# Step 3: Rename the first three columns for better readability
# Assumes the first three columns correspond to:
# - "submitter_id": Unique identifier for each subject
# - "overallsurvival": Overall survival time
# - "deceased": Status of whether the subject is deceased (1) or not (0)
colnames(x)[1:3] <- c("submitter_id", "overallsurvival", "deceased")

# Step 4: Remove the column "ACLY.1" if it exists in the dataset
# This avoids duplication or irrelevant data
x <- x[, !colnames(x) %in% "ACLY.1"]

# Step 5: Replace "0" values in the "overallsurvival" column with NA
# A survival time of 0 is likely invalid or represents missing data
x$overallsurvival[x$overallsurvival == 0] <- NA

# Step 6: Remove rows where "overallsurvival" is NA
# These rows cannot contribute to survival analysis
x <- subset(x, !is.na(x$overallsurvival))

# Step 7: Remove columns containing any NA values
# Ensures the dataset is complete for analysis
x <- x[, colSums(is.na(x)) == 0]

# Step 8: Drop the "vital_status" column
# This column is assumed to be unnecessary for the current analysis
x$vital_status <- NULL

# Step 9: Identify gene expression columns for analysis
# Exclude non-expression columns like "submitter_id", "overallsurvival", and "deceased"
expression_cols <- setdiff(colnames(x), c("submitter_id", "overallsurvival", "deceased"))

# Step 10: Compute the median expression value for each gene expression column
# The median will later be used to categorize expression levels as "High" or "Low"
medians <- sapply(expression_cols, function(col) median(x[[col]], na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Key Points:
1. **File Loading**:
   - Uses `file.choose()` to allow interactive file selection.
   - Loads the file into a dataframe `x` using `read.csv()`.

2. **Column Renaming**:
   - Renames the first three columns to ensure consistent terminology (`submitter_id`, `overallsurvival`, `deceased`).

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handles missing or invalid survival data by replacing `0` values with `NA`.
   - Removes rows and columns with `NA` to prepare clean data for analysis.

4. **Expression Column Identification**:
   - Excludes non-gene expression columns to isolate relevant features.

5. **Median Computation**:
   - Calculates the median for each gene expression column using `sapply()`.
